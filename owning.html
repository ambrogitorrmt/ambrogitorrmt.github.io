		Owning a dog closely resembles having a child of your own. Domesticated animals depend on humans for many
		things, and it's our duty to provide not only the things dogs need to survive, but also other facets of 
		animal care such as training, love, and discipline. <br><br> Before you jump into getting a dog of your
		own, here are a few things you should consider:
		
		<table border="1">
			<tr><td>Can I physically house a dog?</td></tr>
			<tr class="altrow"><td>Which breed is best for me?</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Can I support both myself and the dog I want to get?</td></tr>
			<tr class="altrow"><td>Do my current pets or other people I'm living with get along with dogs?</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Does my lifestyle allow me to care for a dog?</td></tr>
		</table>

			<li><h3>Can I physically house a dog?</h3></li>
			Before anything, it's important to know if the place where you're living is pet-friendly. Many
			apartment complexed have differing rules when it comes to dogs. Some allow them, some don't, and 
			some allow only smaller dogs. It's important to reach out to your landlord or leasing company if 
			you're living in a rented space to see if dogs are allowed. In many cases, landlords or leasing 
			companies require a pet deposit as well, so keep an eye out for that.
