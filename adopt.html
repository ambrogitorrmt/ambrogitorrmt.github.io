		<p>Deciding what breed of dog is a difficult decision, but there's a better way to find out which dog
		would be best for you: Adoption! There are thousands of dogs around the country in shelters that have
		been neglected or given up by their previous owners, and all they need is a comfortable home and someone
		they can depend on. <br><br> The process of &quot;shopping&quot; for a dog usually involves the use of
		puppy mills, which specialize in breeding puppies for sale. Puppy mills are usually very inhumane, and
		there are many dogs in animal shelters and in the streets around the world waiting for fur-ever homes!
		<br><br>
		Here is a chart comparing adopting a dog and shopping for a specific breed:

				<td>Animals vary in age, from newborn puppies up to older animals</td>
				<td>When buying from a breeder, usually you are presented with newborn or very young animals</td>
